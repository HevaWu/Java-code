# Shortest Path
Single sorce shortest paths problem

Find the shortest path in a graph
* Input the int[][] edges info and start node s,
* Output the shortest path value from s to other node in graph

Three methods to implement this 
* Bellman Ford algorithm 
* Directed Acylic Graph methods(DFS topological it at the first)
* Dijkstra algorithm
