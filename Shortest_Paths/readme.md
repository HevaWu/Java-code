# Shortest Path
Single source shortest paths problem
* Find the shortest path in a graph
* * Input the int[][] edges info and start node s,
* * Output the shortest path value from s to other node in graph
* Three methods to implement this 
* * Bellman Ford algorithm 
* * Directed Acylic Graph methods(DFS topological it at the first)
* * Dijkstra algorithm

All-pairs shortest paths problem
* Find the shortest path in a graph
* * Input the int[][] edges info and number of node n
* * Output: 
* * * For each node, print the shortest path value and the path, from current node to other nodes in the graph
* Methods to implement this
* * Matrix Multiplication & Repeated Squaring
